# P2P File Sharing System - Project Presentation

## Overview
The P2P File Sharing System is a decentralized file sharing application that allows users to share and download files directly between peers without relying on a central server for file storage. The system implements a custom P2P protocol for peer discovery and file transfers.

## System Requirements and Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python packages (automatically installed via requirements.txt)

### Installation Steps
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org) if not already installed
2. Download or clone the project files
3. Open a terminal/command prompt
4. Navigate to the project directory
5. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the System
1. To run the system with default settings (localhost):
   ```
   python login_interface.py
   ```

2. To connect to a specific server:
   ```
   python login_interface.py <server_ip>
   ```

Note: No IDE is required to run the system. You only need Python installed and the command line/terminal.

## Key Features

- Bootstrap nodes for initial network connection
- Real-time peer status updates
- Dynamic peer list management

### 3. File Sharing
- Direct peer-to-peer file transfers
- File integrity verification using SHA-256 hashing
- Support for multiple simultaneous transfers
- File name preservation and management

### 4. User Interface
- Modern and intuitive GUI using tkinter
- Real-time file list updates
- File search functionality
- Download progress tracking
- Peer status display

### 5. Security Features
- Secure file transfers
- File integrity verification
- Direct peer connections
- No central file storage

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Server Component**
   - Handles user authentication
   - Manages user accounts
   - Provides initial peer discovery

2. **Client Application**
   - Implements P2P protocol
   - Manages file transfers
   - Provides user interface

3. **P2P Protocol**
   - UDP for peer discovery
   - TCP for file transfers
   - JSON for message formatting
   - Custom message types for different operations

### Data Structures
- Peer list: `{(host, port): last_seen}`
- Shared files: `{file_hash: {'peers': [(host, port)], 'name': str}}`
- Local files: `{file_hash: {'path': str, 'name': str}}`

### Message Types
1. `hello`: Initial peer discovery
2. `hello_response`: Peer information exchange
3. `announce_file`: File availability notification
4. `request_file`: File download request
5. `send_file`: File transfer initiation
6. `goodbye`: Peer disconnection

## Usage Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - User logs in or registers
   - Server validates credentials
   - Session is established

2. **Peer Discovery**
   - Client connects to bootstrap nodes
   - Peers exchange information
   - Network is established

3. **File Sharing**
   - User selects file to share
   - File is hashed and announced
   - Other peers can request the file

4. **File Download**
   - User selects file to download
   - System finds available peers
   - Direct transfer is initiated
   - File integrity is verified

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Peer Discovery**
   - Implemented UDP-based discovery
   - Handled network latency
   - Managed dynamic peer lists

2. **File Transfers**
   - Ensured reliable transfers
   - Implemented chunked transfers
   - Added error handling

3. **User Interface**
   - Created responsive GUI
   - Implemented real-time updates
   - Added user-friendly features

## Future Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Security
- Implement end-to-end encryption for file transfers
- Add digital signatures for file verification
- Implement secure peer authentication
- Add support for encrypted file names

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement file chunking for large files
- Add parallel downloads from multiple peers
- Implement bandwidth throttling
- Add transfer resumption capability

### 3. User Experience
- Add drag-and-drop file sharing
- Implement file previews
- Add transfer speed indicators
- Create a mobile application version

### 4. Network Features
- Implement NAT traversal
- Add support for IPv6
- Implement DHT for better peer discovery
- Add support for proxy connections

### 5. Additional Features
- Add file versioning support
- Implement file sharing groups
- Add file commenting and rating
- Implement file metadata search
- Add support for streaming media files

### 6. Monitoring and Management
- Add detailed transfer statistics
- Implement network health monitoring
- Add peer performance metrics
- Create admin dashboard

### 7. Scalability Improvements
- Implement distributed file indexing
- Add support for supernodes
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Add support for load balancing
